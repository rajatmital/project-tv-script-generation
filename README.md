# project-tv-script-generation

Applyting Recurrent Neural Network to generate TV scripts. Developed as coursework in the "Deep Learning Fundamentals" Nanodegree @ Udacity. This project passed all specifications as shown in the project information section

Project Information
The function create_lookup_tables create two dictionaries: vocab_to_int and int_to_vocab
The function token_lookup returns a dict that can correctly tokenizes the provided symbols.
Implemented the get_inputs function to create TF Placeholders for the Neural Network with Input, Target and Learning Rate placeholders.
Enough epochs to get near a minimum in the training loss, no real upper limit on this. Just need to make sure the training loss is low and not improving much with more training.
Batch size is large enough to train efficiently, but small enough to fit the data in memory. No real “best” value here, depends on GPU memory usually.
Size of the RNN cells (number of units in the hidden layers) is large enough to fit the data well. Again, no real “best” value.
The sequence length (seq_length) here should be about the size of the length of sentences you want to generate. Should match the structure of the data.
Results
The TV Script generated and have similar characteristics to the original tv scripts, the results are pretty fun! The following TV script was generated:

homer_simpson:(beligerent) oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya...

carl_carlson: hey, i'm worried.

homer_simpson: i've had just about enough of you.

moe_szyslak: so we, uh... homer's been gone a drunk.

moe_szyslak:(covering nervous laughing) i got hooked on this stuff in the service.

homer_simpson:(quietly) hi, moe. this is why... that's all right.

moe_szyslak:(sighs) what's the point?... same ol' stinkin' world... ah, i'm gonna be sick tonight.

barney_gumble: hey moe, you wanna smell my flower?

moe_szyslak:(genuinely enthused) do i?!

moe_szyslak:(laughs) usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. but, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. jeez, i can't less of my blood and sweat are in this drink.

moe_szyslak: anyway, you got it, moe.(shuts off) so goodbye...

chief_wiggum:(singing) so you better make that call to the plow king.

homer_simpson: how could you, barney? after all you,(tearfully) you get that car?

moe_szyslak: oh, what? i suppose you've seen a bigger star?

homer_simpson:(coy) i might have.

lenny_leonard: come on, there's sexy bald like...

moe_szyslak:(while poking, friendly) so, hey, did you see the game last night?

...

seymour_skinner: homer, still not private?

moe_szyslak: sure, we're
